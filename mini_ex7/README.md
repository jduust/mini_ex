## Code + Language

**Libraries:** _RiTa.js_, _p5.Speech.js_.
**note:** Works poorly on FireFox, use Chrome, edge or other preferred browser.
**Inspiration:** Vocable code - by Geoff Cox.

### The Program
A sentence modulator. By the submission of a sentence chosen by the user, written into an input bar followed by the click of a "submit" button, executes an infinite loop of events. After submitting the sentence, the program splits up the sentence into single words that are then analyzed to find the part-of-speech (pos) tag for the given word (nn - noun, jj - adjective, vb - verb). A random word from the sentence is then chosen by the program to be replaced with a word with the same pos-tag. The words are put back together as the same sentence, but with one word swapped with a new one. The sentence is written on the screen in the form of text and the program starts reading it out loud. When the program is done talking, the whole process is once again being executed, but now the input sentence is the new one, generated by the program. So again a random word is chosen and changed depending on its pos-tag. This goes on forever, continually manipulating the sentence that drifts further and further from the original sentence, and becomes totally unrecognizable from it.
Once the loop has been executed by the click of the button, it can't be stopped, But the user can refresh the program by submitting a new sentence. This will clear the canvas and start transforming the new sentence scratch.
### Thoughts
This program expresses the notion of literacy by it's ability to read, write and speak a language (in this case the English language). Its ability to define the pos-tags of the words, even conceptualizes the idea of the program actually understanding what it is reading, though it is just getting it's knowledge from a giant lexicon consisting of words and their information. One thought this program creates, reflects on literacy in connection to the machine instead of the literacy of man, it is about how well the machine is capable of reading, writing and understanding language. How close are we to have deep conversations with the machine in the same language? Or even engage in collaborative linguistic discussions?   

This program also sheds light upon how intertwined code and language has become, and even the relationship of man and machine. If you take a look at the source code for this program, you see that almost the whole code consist of understandable words (considered you are familiar with English language), by exception there is only a few symbols and abbreviations requiring a broader background knowledge of programming semiotics. This means, that with only a little understanding of programming, you would probably be able to read the source code and generate an idea of how the program works that is fairly close to the reality. This of course, is in many ways thanks to the p5.js library, but also the development of the JavaScript programming language, continually making it more understandable. The use of libraries gives you the advantage of skipping a lot of hardcoding by using complex functions that can be executed by a single understandable English word (that would otherwise have needed several lines of code). A programming library visualieses very well one of the layers that is put on top of the basics of computer code and computer programming in order to make programming more accessible and understandable. These layers though, pushes us further and further away from the mechanical understanding of the core of programming, making programming less transparent to it's mechanics.

This leads to the debate of coding literacy, how well do we actually understand code with the increasing lack of transparency "black  boxing" us from the core mechanics of programming? Also taking into consideration, the increasing resemblance between some programing languages and the English language.
