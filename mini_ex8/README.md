### The Program
When the program has loaded, you se a dark world map with a lot of colored circles ind different sizes, continually expanding and contracting themselves a little bit, creating an illusion of motion. The position of the circles indicates where an earthquake has struck within the last week, the size of the cirkel is indicating the magnitude level of the earthquake (big cirkel = high magnitude), the same is the color of the cirkel. There is also some text appearing close to some of the cirkels stating the name of the location, this text only appears with earthquakes of a really high magnitude (Sorry for the overlapping text). In the bottom-left corner of the canvas there are changing titles of today's news on earthquakes with the source of the story on top of it. 

### The Data
The program is using three different data sources that it relies on for the program to work. When the program is executed, it makes an API request to api.mapbox.com for the image (loadImage()) showing the world map with the wanted aspects. Then the earthquake data is requiered, that is taken from a URL from earthquake.usgs.gov containing a CSV file (can be opened with ms Excel and loaded with loadString()). To show the latest news on "Earthquakes", another api request is made, now to newsapi.org with the query "earthquake", this responce is recieved in for of a JSON file (loadJSON()).   

An interesting mistake we made, trying to get the latest news with the search word earthquake  

### Data manipulation and visualisation
Some of the earthquake data had to be manipulated before it could be used in the program. First of all, since the lattitude and longitude is meant to place something on a sphere, it cannot be used as direct locations on the square form world map, therefore a webmercator formula is used to convert the numbers into something that can be used as x and y values in the program. Another formula is used with the magnitude, since, if the number is one point bigger then another it doesn't mean that it is just one time bigger than the other, instead it might be 10 times bigger. The formula then helps making a more accurate sizing of the cirkels.
