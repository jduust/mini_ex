## The Coding Proces
I was already privileged with a small knowdledge of different coding languages, nothing major, but enough to have a general idea of the structure of coding. Beforehand i have played a little around with html, CSS, JavaScript, JAVA, PHP, not enough to code anything complicated, but enough to understand the basics of them. This made me able to jump right into it and start modifying and writing code, just from the understanding of reading it. Though taking the P5.js reference list in to use, quickly expanded my knowdledge and understanding of the different posibilities with the javascript language and the p5 library.
