## The Coding Proces
I was already privileged with a small knowdledge of different coding languages, nothing major, but enough to have a general idea of the structure of coding. Beforehand i have played a little around with html, CSS, JavaScript, JAVA, PHP, not enough to code anything complicated, but enough to understand the basics of them. This made me able to jump right into it and start modifying and writing code, just from the understanding of reading it. Though taking the P5.js reference list in to use, quickly expanded my knowdledge and understanding of the different posibilities with the javascript language and the p5 library. 

## Coding compared to reading and writing text
Coding languages as with any other languange, you have to know it to be able to understand it. You can copy and paste code to make things work, but you can't really modify it and use it in a kontekst before you know why is does what i does and how it does it. In my experience, reading code teaches you a lot about it, as like reading texts in a foreign language expands your knowdledge of it. 
  Coding compared to writing are similar in some ways, you can formulate things in different ways but stil resulting with the same output. But the different recieveres changes the way in which we do it. A person reading a text is able to reflect on it and is often able to make sense of errors. but the machine reading a code cannot tolerate a single error, the syntax of the code has to be perfect.

## The possibilities of coding practice
Learning code opens up a whole new world of insight and knowledge In the digital world we live in today, it offers an understanding of how all the digital things we use in our everyday life works. When you learn a language it makes you able to think in that language, the same counts for coding. So being able to think in code you then get the ability to think in new ways, new ways of generating ideas and also new ways of creating things.
