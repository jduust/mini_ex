### Temporality
/ˌtɛmpəˈralɪti/
noun

**1.** the state of existing within or having some relationship with time.

*"like spatial position, temporality is an intrinsic property of the object"*

## A Throbber
How do we experience Temporality being an intrinsic property of the object considered in comparison to this program, that is an attempt on creating a “Throbber”. The Throbber is a process indicating graphical animation, that through visual communication tells the viewer that processual tasks - that cannot be seen - is executing in the “background”. it tells us that something is happening in the ‘now’, so that we will have to wait until it has run its course before we can continue what we were doing or experience the result of what we were hoping to achieve. The Throbber is a never-ending and continuously looping animated motion that does not give much information except feeding our conventions of data processing and code interactions operated in real-time. It does not grand us any form of status or progress indication, nothing tells us how long we will have to wait, it is indeterminate, it just tells us that we ‘must’ wait. How this takes form in my program is a continuously slow-phased floating box, floating just above an invisible “surface”, only visible from a shadow created by the box, expanding and contracting with the movement. Taped to the box – on all visible sides – is a hand drumming its fingers on yet another invisible surface, conventionally indicating a movement of someone who is bored or restless. The animation of the box is expressing calmness in its slow movements, but is also being provocative by kind of indicating that you are wasting time while it is shown. The objects relationship to time express itself mostly through the phase of the movements, a fast-phased movement would indicate something that is working fast, and the slow phase movements indicates something that is taking its time and not rushing. If we see something completely still we experience it as if time has stopped.

### Thoughts of the Throbbers cultural influence
The Throbber relating to a web browser is of course often associated with the perception of slowness of a network. But is it the Throbber connected to the position of your cursor, it often brings forth the fear of the computer or program crashing. This considered our technology today often doesn’t need much loading time and seems to work instantly, so if a Throbber appears it is often in the case of a system error. I remember being willing to wait longer, starring at the Throbber than I do today, back when the machines where executing slower and the speed of the internet wasn’t like it is today, the wait time made more sense. 

I kind of like the word precariousness in connection to the Throbber, a word describing one as being dependent on circumstances beyond one’s control, being uncertain, unstable and insecure. As with a precarious existence, while the Throbber show itself you are fully lacking predictability and control of the situation and are left with interdependency on the non-human.
 
*"In other words, data travels “via highly circuitous paths that could not be determined in advance” ".*
**= the unpredictability**
 
*"in the case of technological networks, the response may not include direct human intervention, and machines take charge of decisions and in real-time and responses in a forced duration." *
**= interdependency on the non-human.**
