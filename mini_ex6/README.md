## Object Orientation
Unfortunately i did not have much time for this one, so this is just one of Daniel Shiffmans coding challenges with a few changes and addings. It was interesting working with different objects in form of classes, also working out how to use them as secondary files that needs to be called upon by the code in the sketch file. in this progtram there are several objects in use, the "bird", the pipes and a scoreboard.
