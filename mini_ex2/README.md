## Description of the program
By making this program, I know got a better understanding of using the "If and else" functions, "and" and "or" statements and the use of defining my own functions. Also, I experienced how it can be necessary to use the push() and pop() functions.

The program is a “Shithole Country Detector” made for, and in the spirit of the president of the United States, Donald Trump. It will tell you what country’s that are “Shithole Country’s” (Declared from no source or data at all, just like when Donald Trump tweets). It does actually just define everything around Africa and the middle east as “Shithole Country’s” (the bottom- left corner of the canvas). The program works with you moving around with mouse on the map that is the background, instead of the cursor you have a coloured ellipse with lines attached to it. When the mouse is clicked, the ellipse and lines will pin on, and, depending on your position on the map tell you whether if that, which is in that position is a “Shithole Country” or “Not a Shithole Country”. Clicking again will unpin the position and you will once again be able to move the ellipse and lines around on the map.

## The program compared to Gorinova's notion of fun
“What this book aims to do is to create conditions in which computing can be seen as an excessive and intensive scale and order, which can and do take part in forming and acting in transversal ensembles that are more than those of the neoliberal machinery, administrative applicability or calculative completeness and functionalism.”(Goriunova, olga – Fun and software, pp 6-7) 
Compared to the conditions of computing that Goriunova tries to create with her book, I managed to create something kind of excessive. This because the properties of the program fits under the fact that they are not very functional or in any way complete. The program just considers what defines as a “Shithole Country” from a prejudiced viewpoint, without any facts, data or description of what defines a “Shithole Country”. The program could have been coupled to a realistic data source and have clear definition of the meaning of the output, and therefore have a something closer to calculative completeness. Instead the program can be classified as absurd, ironic and useless. The notion fun shows through in creating an interactive program that mocks Donald Trump’s statement about some particular country’s being “Shithole Country’s”.  The program is ironic because it does not have any output of truth and because of that it loses its functionality.
