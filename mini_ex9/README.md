### Thoughts on drawing flowcharts

_"If we want to live with the machine, we must understand the machine, we must not
worship the machine."_ **Norbert Wiener**'

By creating a flowchart you can visualize ideas or structures of your program, or the program that you intend to make. It is a way to map the functions and executions of the program and you can picturize the iterations. Something as complex as an algorithm can be, can be broken down into elements and made graspable by visualizing the path of executions. As Ed Finn describes it, _"An algorithm is a recipe, an instruction set, a sequence of tasks to achieve a particular calculation or result, like the steps needed to calculate a square root or tabulate the Fibonacci sequence."_. By this notion, the flowchart can be described as the recipe, explaining the step by step path of tasks that need to be done. 

The difficulties you encounter in creating a flowchart, is the sometimes enormous complexity that needs to be visually translated into somehting somewhat simplistic that can be easily understood. Therefore it is important to reflect upon what that needs to be left out and what that need to included. Here you encounter the problem, that the program/algorithm often relies of most of the aspects inlucded. _"Algorithmic thinking encodes the computationalist vision, the maximalist idea that all complex systems will eventually be made equivalent through computational representation."_ (Ed Finn, p43). As i understand it, the algorithm is a somewhat naming and framing of a computational vision, it is an explanation of what needs to be done and how it is going to be done.

There is a lot of aspects that needs to be taking into consideration before creating a flowchart. Is it made in the desinprocess, creating an overview of the necessary technicalities of the artefact that is being developed, it is allowed to have a higher complexity since the flowchart plays a role mostly or only for the peers engaged in the creation. Another scenario, is a flowchart ment for visualizing a concept to an external audience, this meaning that this audience might not necessarily be familiar with the core technicalities or syntax of the field, therefore these needs to be translated into something that is more globably understandble.

## Ideas for the final project

**Idea:** Neuralizer of web content

We mainly want to focus on the topic of code and language in the digital culture. We want to create a program that can manipulate what is visuably accesible to you, and often forced upon you while you are engaged in the digital world. We want to challange the lacking of control of the contemporary constant feeds and data streams that we experience on the web. This by creating something that affords the individual to choose and take control of what is shown to them and therefore make web content from external sources less powerful (ex. the brower extension AdBlock).

Our ideas strives from a program that removes adjektives, to one that neutralizes genders or even one that can change negative words into positive ones. To make a program with functions like these, we will have to make a web extension that is able to examine the content of the current webpage and be able replace or manipulate it.

The flowchart we have made for this idea is based on an algorithm that is supposed to get the news articles from a website, analyse the text for adjectives and then remove them. When the program as gone through the whole text it shal print the new and changed article.
