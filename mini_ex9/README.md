# MINI_EX8 Flowchart
**Inspiration:** _Ed Finn, “What is an Algorithm,” in What Algorithms Want, MIT Press, 2017, pp. 15-56._

### Thoughts on drawing flowcharts

_"If we want to live with the machine, we must understand the machine, we must not
worship the machine."_ **Norbert Wiener**'

By creating a flowchart you can visualize ideas or structures of your program, or the program that you intend to make. It is a way to map the functions and executions of the program and you can picturize the iterations. Something as complex as an algorithm can be, can be broken down into elements and made graspable by visualizing the path of executions. As Ed Finn describes it, _"An algorithm is a recipe, an instruction set, a sequence of tasks to achieve a particular calculation or result, like the steps needed to calculate a square root or tabulate the Fibonacci sequence."_. By this notion, the flowchart can be described as the recipe, explaining the step by step path of tasks that need to be done. 

The difficulties you encounter in creating a flowchart, is the sometimes enormous complexity that needs to be visually translated into somehting somewhat simplistic that can be easily understood. Therefore it is important to reflect upon what that needs to be left out and what that need to included. Here you encounter the problem, that the program/algorithm often relies of most of the aspects inlucded. _"Algorithmic thinking encodes the computationalist vision, the maximalist idea that all complex systems will eventually be made equivalent through computational representation."_ (Ed Finn, p43). As i understand it, the algorithm is a somewhat naming and framing of a computational vision, it is an explanation of what needs to be done and how it is going to be done.

There is a lot of aspects that needs to be taking into consideration before creating a flowchart. Is it made in the desinprocess, creating an overview of the necessary technicalities of the artefact that is being developed, it is allowed to have a higher complexity since the flowchart plays a role mostly or only for the peers engaged in the creation. Another scenario, is a flowchart ment for visualizing a concept to an external audience, this meaning that this audience might not necessarily be familiar with the core technicalities or syntax of the field, therefore these needs to be translated into something that is more globably understandble.

## Ideas for the final project

**Idea:** Neuralizer of web content

We want to mainly focus on the topic of code and language. 


Code and Language
Reference: M.U.C - lover letter generator (1952, Christopher Strachey)
Pseudo-randomness
E-lit
Discussion between machines
Ændrer nyhedsartikler til at være positive eller upolitiske
Gender neutralizing bot (GNB) 
Digital fascism/Online activism
Digital culture (Contemporary digital cultures)
The copy-paste culture (easy sharing of far right content) - (ref - facebook demetricator)

Neutralisering af web-indhold (nyheder, post eller lign.)
Fjerner adjektiver?
Erstatter køn og erstatter med neutrale ord som person, hen, osv.?
Erstatter negative ord med positive?
(evt. Set som en mulig browser exstention)
